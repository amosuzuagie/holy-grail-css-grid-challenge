# holy-grail-css-grid-challenge

## Project Overview

In this challenge, I build the [Holy Grail](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)>) CSS Layout using CSS Grid.

You can see the solution to this challenge on the [Github Pages branch](https://amosuzuagie.github.io/holy-grail-css-grid-challenge/) of this repository.

This is part of Jacks [#fullstackroadmap series](https://www.zachgollwitzer.com/posts/2021/fullstack-developer-series/introduction/), which will take you from a complete beginner (no coding experience) to deploying your first full-stack E-Commerce app with ReactJS.
